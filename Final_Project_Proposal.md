### 2019311801 Lee, Gyunseo

## 1. Problem Statement and Research Question:

### Problem Identification:

Managing events and activities within clubs is often a manual process fraught with inefficiencies and prone to human error. This traditional approach consumes considerable time and resources, detracting from the overall effectiveness and engagement within the club.

### Research Question:

How can we extend or enhance the existing chatbot to automate the management of events and activities in the club, thereby increasing operational efficiency and boosting member participation?

## 2. Time Investment and Methodological Approach:

### 1. Requirement Analysis

    - Objective: Conduct interviews with club members to gather detailed requirements for needed chatbot functionalities.
    - Activities: Organize focus groups and surveys to determine the features members find most valuable, such as event reminders, RSVP tracking, and feedback collection.

### 2: Feature Design

    -	Objective: Design the new functionalities to be added to the chatbot, focusing on user-friendly interfaces and seamless integration with existing club operations.
    -	Activities: Create design prototypes for features like automatic event notification systems, RSVP management tools, and interactive feedback forms.

### 3-4: Development and Integration

    -	Objective: Develop and integrate the designed features into the existing chatbot platform (e.g., Slack, Discord).
    -	Activities: Write code for new features, test for bugs, and ensure compatibility with current chatbot operations. Collaborate with IT specialists if necessary.

### 5: Testing and Evaluation

    -	Objective: Deploy the updated chatbot in a live club environment to test functionality and gather user feedback.
    -	Activities: Monitor interaction with the chatbot during actual events, collect data on user engagement and satisfaction, and identify areas for improvement.

### 6: Documentation and Presentation Preparation

    - Objective: Document the development process, results, and user feedback, and prepare a detailed presentation for club members and stakeholders.
    - Activities: Compile findings in a comprehensive report, highlighting challenges, successes, and recommendations for future enhancements. Develop a PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project.

## Additional Notes:

    -	Flexibility: Be prepared to iterate on software development based on feedback and testing results.
    -	Documentation: Maintain thorough documentation throughout the project to ensure continuity and ease of understanding for all stakeholders.
    -	Feedback Loops: Implement regular check-ins with club members during the project to ensure the chatbot meets their needs and to refine the tool based on real user experiences.
